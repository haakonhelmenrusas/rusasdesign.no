 * Used to fetch data in Server Components, it has built in support for handling Draft Mode and perspectives.
 * When using the "published" perspective then time-based revalidation is used, set to match the time-to-live on Sanity's API CDN (60 seconds)
 * and will also fetch from the CDN.
 * When using the "previewDrafts" perspective then the data is fetched from the live API and isn't cached, it will also fetch draft content that isn't published yet.
